# Movies-ETL
This projext was about extracting, transforming and loading data. We had to refactor the code from the module we had learnt in this module to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
